  * Developed a Multi-View pipeline for the Visual Weighing Machine (VWM) project for reducing thickness ambiguity from predictions.
  * Formulated and implemented a novel Depth-Aware weak-perspecitive camera for Geometry based Deep Learning pipelines.
  * Formulated and implemented a model architecture fusing Multi-View with Geometry which can make scale aware predictions for a subject using a supplementary object.
  * The overall algorithm increased the performance of the VWM pipeline by over 26% on validation and over 14% on test (MAE).
